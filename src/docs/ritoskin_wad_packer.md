# Get Started
To help people contribute and make their lives easier by fixing skins and adding new ones, I've created a WAD packer that will help you pack your files into a WAD file.

# How to use
- Create a folder named as you like;
- Drag and drop the `ritoskin_wad_packer` into the folder;
- Drag and drop the champion folder into the same folder;
- Run the executable and wait for the process to finish;

# Example of usage
- Champion skin `Winterbless Diana` has a problem with the `Q` ability, and you want to fix it;
- You will extract `Winterbless Diana` folder from `Obsidian`;
- You will fix the `Q` ability;
- You create a folder named as you like;
- Drag and drop the `ritoskin_wad_packer.exe` and fixed folder `Winterbless Diana` into the folder;
- Run the executable and wait for the process to finish;
- It will result in a `Winterbless Diana.zip` file;
- Go into the `cslol-manager` application and drag and drop the `Winterbless Diana.zip` file;
- Test the skin in the game;
- Open PR with the fixed skin;
